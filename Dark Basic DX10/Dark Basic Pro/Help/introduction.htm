Welcome to DarkBASIC Professional<BR>
The Ultimate Programming Language for your PC!<BR>
</FONT></CENTER><BR>
No matter what type of game you plan to make, by providing rapid development solutions, Dark Basic Professional has the power to handle them all. It does all this and remains the easiest programming language available.<BR>
<BR>
The original Dark Basic was designed in 1999 to facilitate the easy programming of 3D computer games on the PC. The combination of ease and power was an instant hit, and a vibrant and creative community grew up around the language. With the emergence of new technology and techniques, it was clear the evolution of the language should race to meet these new advances. After two years of development, Dark Basic Professional is born.<BR>
