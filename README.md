# FPS-Creator-X10
Source code and IDE for FPS Creator X10

To compile the X10 executables
==============================

Overview
--------

The Map Editor executable is compiled using a legacy version of DBP and the Game executable is compiled using an experimental legacy version of DBP for DirectX 10. This experimental version, along with all the source code and processes herein are entirely unsupported and should be regarded as unofficial code allowing you some freedom to mod the original map editor and game engine.

FPSC-MapEditor.exe
------------------

1. Run "Dark Basic DX9\Dark Basic Pro\Editor\CodeSurge.exe"

2. Select FILE > OPEN PROJECT to open a project browser

3. Navigate to the folder FPSCREATORX10 and select 'FPSC-MapEditor (DX9).dbpro'

4. Select COMPILE > COMPILE ONLY to compile the source code

5. You will find the resulting executable in FPSCREATORX10

FPSC-Game.exe
-------------

1. Run "Dark Basic DX10\Dark Basic Pro\Editor\CodeSurge.exe"

2. Select FILE > OPEN PROJECT to open a project browser

3. Navigate to the folder FPSCREATORX10 and select 'FPSC-Game (DX10-mature).dbpro'

4. Select COMPILE > COMPILE ONLY to compile the source code

5. You will find the resulting executable in FPSCREATORX10

Cannot find Dark Basic Pro
--------------------------

NOTE: When you first launch the CODESURGE editor, it may ask you to locate where Dark Basic Pro is installed. If prompted, direct the dialog to point to the 'Dark Basic Pro' folder inside the respective parent folder (if you ran the editor from Dark Basic DX10, chose Dark Basic DX10\Dark Basic Pro).
